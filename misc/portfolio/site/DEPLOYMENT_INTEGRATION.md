## Setup Instructions

### 1. GitHub CLI Setup & Authentication

#### Install GitHub CLI
```bash
# Windows (using winget)
winget install --id GitHub.cli

# Windows (using Chocolatey)
choco install gh

# macOS
brew install gh

# Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)
curl -fsSL https://cli.github.com/packages/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg | sudo dd of=/usr/share/keyrings/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg
echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg] https://cli.github.com/packages stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/github-cli.list > /dev/null
sudo apt update
sudo apt install gh
```

#### Authenticate with GitHub
```bash
# Login to GitHub (opens browser for authentication)
gh auth login

# Select options:
# ? What account do you want to log into? GitHub.com
# ? What is your preferred protocol for Git operations? HTTPS
# ? Authenticate Git with your GitHub credentials? Yes
# ? How would you like to authenticate GitHub CLI? Login with a web browser

# Verify authentication
gh auth status
```

### 2. Create Personal Access Token

#### Option A: Using GitHub CLI (Recommended)
```bash
# Create token with required scopes
gh auth refresh -h github.com -s repo,workflow,actions:read

# Or create a new token specifically for this project
gh auth token
```

#### Option B: Manual Creation via GitHub Web Interface
1. Go to GitHub Settings â†’ Developer settings â†’ Personal access tokens â†’ Tokens (classic)
2. Click "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Set expiration and select scopes:
   - âœ… `repo` (Full control of private repositories)
   - âœ… `workflow` (Update GitHub Action workflows) 
   - âœ… `actions:read` (Read access to actions and workflows)
4. Click "Generate token"
5. Copy the token immediately (it won't be shown again)

#### Verify Token Permissions
```bash
# Test API access with your token
curl -H "Authorization: token YOUR_TOKEN_HERE" https://api.github.com/user

# Test workflow access
gh api repos/omesh7/aws-portfolio/actions/workflows
```

### 3. Environment Variables

Add to your `.env.local` file:

```bash
# GitHub API Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_personal_access_token_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_GITHUB_REPO_OWNER=omesh7
NEXT_PUBLIC_GITHUB_REPO_NAME=aws-portfolio
```

### 3. Workflow Requirements

Each deployable project must have a corresponding GitHub Actions workflow file in `.github/workflows/` with:

- `workflow_dispatch` trigger
- `action` input parameter (`deploy` or `destroy`)
- Proper job names and step identification

Example workflow structure:
```yaml
name: Project Deploy
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      action:
        description: 'Action to perform'
        required: true
        type: choice
        options: ['deploy', 'destroy']
        default: 'deploy'

jobs:
  deploy:
    if: inputs.action == 'deploy'
    # ... deployment steps
  
  destroy:
    if: inputs.action == 'destroy'
    # ... destruction steps
```

## Components

### DeploymentStatus
Compact deployment status component for project cards:
- Real-time status badges
- Progress indicators
- Quick action buttons
- Error display

### DeploymentManager
Full-featured deployment management component:
- Detailed status information
- Complete action controls
- Live URL access
- Comprehensive error handling

### DeploymentDashboard
Centralized dashboard for all projects:
- Status overview cards
- Tabbed project views
- Bulk status refresh
- Real-time monitoring

### useWorkflowStatus Hook
Custom React hook for workflow management:
- Status polling
- Action triggering
- Error handling
- Automatic refresh logic

## Project Mapping

Projects are mapped to their corresponding workflow files in `lib/github-api.ts`:

```typescript
const PROJECT_MAPPINGS = {
  "image-resizer": {
    workflowFile: "project-06-deploy.yml",
    displayName: "Smart Image Resizer",
  },
  "2048-game-cicd": {
    workflowFile: "project-13-deploy.yml",
    displayName: "2048 Game CI/CD",
  },
  // ... more projects
};
```

## Status Flow

1. **Idle**: No recent deployments
2. **Queued**: Workflow triggered, waiting to start
3. **In Progress**: Deployment actively running
4. **Completed**: Successful deployment
5. **Failed**: Deployment encountered errors
6. **Cancelled**: Deployment was cancelled

## Navigation

Access the deployment dashboard via:
- **Main Navigation**: "Deployments" link in navbar
- **Direct URL**: `/deployments`
- **Project Cards**: Individual deployment controls

## Security Considerations

- GitHub token is client-side (use with caution in production)
- Consider implementing server-side API routes for production
- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Use environment-specific tokens

## Monitoring & Debugging

- Check browser console for API errors
- Verify GitHub token permissions
- Ensure workflow files exist and are properly configured
- Monitor GitHub Actions tab for workflow execution details

## Future Enhancements

- Server-side API routes for enhanced security
- Webhook integration for real-time updates
- Deployment history and logs
- Cost tracking and optimization alerts
- Multi-environment support (dev/staging/prod)
